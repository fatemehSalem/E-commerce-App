      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1
      KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR: 1

These three configurations are related to Kafka's fault tolerance and data durability mechanisms. They specifically deal with how Kafka handles internal topics and logs that are crucial for the system's operation. Let's break down each configuration:

**KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR:** Determines the fault tolerance for the consumer offsets by specifying how many copies of the offsets topic should exist.

**KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_REPLICATION_FACTOR**: Determines the fault tolerance for transactional state by specifying how many copies of the transaction state log should exist.

**KAFKA_TRANSACTION_STATE_LOG_MIN_ISR**: Ensures a minimum number of in-sync replicas for the transaction state log, providing a safety guarantee that transactions are committed only when sufficiently replicated.
